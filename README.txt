Resources:
Tiles - https://www.mapeditor.org/ - to make map levels
coin effect: https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/game/

changes made:
1) player regains all health when they go back to overworld
2) made sure that health never exceeds max health
3) when player touches crate, they gain health
4) water slowly rises and player takes damage when they touch the water

Focus:
1) redesign levels w/ intention of water slowly rising - lvl 5 + 6 should be water rising levels
2) move levels. level 2 should be water rising level
3) fix rise speed still too slow
4) timer for level 3-6

NOTES BC CONFUSING:
labeled level 3/in game level 4 - empty. 
currently working on labeled level 2 / in game 3
level 5 may need to be swapped
later on maybe labeled level 2 will need to be 5 and 5 will go to labeled 3 or 2. 

IDEAS my adjustments from original:
1) redesign of levels: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJMDh9QGRgs&list=PL8ui5HK3oSiGXM2Pc2DahNu1xXBf7WQh-&index=3
2) timer that starts at level 3 and ends at 6. 
3) starting at level 5: water slowly raises as player goes through level. if they don't complete the level before water touches player, they die. 
4) home screen. start game button + directions (silver 1, gold 5, jump on enemies, don't touch water, if you get 20 coins, you get a speed boost). 
5) when you touch the treasure box, you get a speed boost
6) collect 20 coins - special power
7) gold coin - special power
8) FIX - every time i touch enemy i take dmg
9) moving platforms
10) diff color enemies that swim during water levels
11) high score screen?
